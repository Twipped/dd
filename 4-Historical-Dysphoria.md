# Hystorical Dysphoria

Hystorical Gender Dysphoria stems from how an individual was perceived in the past. This may come from memories of events that have gendered connotations, may come from historical documentation bearing assigned information, and far more typically centers on how those around an individual refer to their past. This ties directly into Social Dysphoria, as this often involves pronoun and name usage. Antagonists may be one's own memories, recalled memories of others, institutional organizations (such as governments or utilities), or even feelings of loss of gendered youth experiences.
