# The Gender Dysphoria Database
This repository attempts to provide an example catalog of some of the various manifestations of Gender Dysphoria in Transgender individuals.

Gender Dysphoria (as defined by the WPATH Standards of Care) refers to discomfort or distress that is caused by a discrepancy between a person’s gender identity and that person’s sex assigned at birth (and the associated gender role and/or primary and secondary sex characteristics).

The curators of this repository **DO NOT** subscribe to the belief that an individual must be experiencing Gender Dysphoria in order to be transgender. However, many individuals who think they are not experiencing dysphoria later come to recognize ways that dysphoria has been present all along. Gender Dysphoria is extremely varied and personal, manifesting in numerous forms and experiences. The purpose of this repository is to provide simple descriptions of the many ways that GD may present in both obvious and subtle ways, in hopes that individuals who are questioning their gender and/or identity may find answers.

The curators of this repository **DO NOT** subscribe to a binary essentialist view of gender; Gender is a spectrum and all gender variants are valid. The repository attempts to use non-binary inclusive language. If a description is flawed, please be patient with us and submit an issue or pull request with alternative text.

**This is not an exhaustive or authoritative list**. If you do not find a description here that applies to you, this does not mean that you are not trans. If you find descriptions on this list which do apply to you, that does not mean you have to transition or identify as transgender. This repository is intended to be a community resource, not a diagnostic tool.

## How to use this repository

Symptoms have been divided into four categories.

1. [Physical Dysphoria](1-Physical-Dysphoria.md) (Primary and secondary sexual characteristics)
2. [Societal Dysphoria](2-Societal-Dysphoria.md) (Established roles and gendered expectations)
3. [Social Dysphoria](3-Social-Dysphoria.md) (Perceptions of gender, including name and pronouns)
4. [Historical Dysphoria](4-Historical-Dysphoria.md) (Memories of gendered experiences in the past)

Gender Dysphoria manifests both negatively (dysphoria) and positively (euphoria), and may present in the form of happy experiences without the presence of negative emotions, so this repository attempts to provide both negative and positive examples where possible.
