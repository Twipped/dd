# Social Dysphoria

Social Dysphoria stems from the way that other people perceive your gender in day to day interactions. The most common form of social dysphoria stems from the pronouns used in reference to an individual and the name used by and for that individual, but also registers in body language and behavior towards a person. Social Dysphoria is always antagonized by third parties and is rooted in how both associates and strangers interact with a person.
